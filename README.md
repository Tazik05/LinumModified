# Linum Framework Modified

Linum Framework Modified is a redesigned original Linum Framework engine with a lot of things that were borrowed from other sonic engines


## FAQ

~~I'll write something else here later~~


#### Game controls

Arrows - walk

Z -Action

ESC - Pause

` - Open the console

#### Installing plugins and Behaviors
`Most likely you will not be able to run this engine without installing add-ons, so follow the instructions below`

First you have to download `behaviors` and `plugins`, after that you have to go to the folder with the installed Construct 2. Now go to the path: `construct2\exporters\html5` and move the `plugins` and `behaviors` folder there, if a file replacement request appears, then confirm it

 Now restart construct 2 (if it was open) and you will be able to run a preview of the engine

 It is also recommended to install [NWJS](https://www.construct.net/en/construct-2/nwjs) for a better usage experience.
 #### Global Settings
`This is the main thing that you will have to configure, depending on your needs`
